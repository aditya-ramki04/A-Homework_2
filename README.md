For this assignment, we worked together each completing one function each to evenly distribute the work load. 
Our first Github repository failed as we were trying to merege our files together. Here is the link to the first Github repository to check our git commits 
to see our commits.

Functions we wrote:

Abhinav P: Read from File and Initialize Objects
Aditya R: Update Student Information
Matthew R: Search Students
Nitin C: Display Students

Upon the completion of this project, Abhi and Nitin had an error module download error. This didn't happen to Aditya and Matthew, so Abhi and Nitin just deleted the file
and re-imported the file and it worked properly.
